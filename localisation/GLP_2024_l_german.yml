In three months' time, under the watchful eye of the Sejm Speaker, who will oversee and organize the assembly, the fate of Poland will be discussed and debated. Great matters of state demand attention. Will the nobility stand united for the good of the realm, or will factionalism reign supreme?\n\nAs the Polish nobles prepare to gather, whispers of foreign influence circulate through the halls. Several powerful foreign nobles are expected to attend, their alliances and ambitions potentially shifting the balance of power. Will their presence strengthen Poland, or lead to a dangerous division?\n\nPrepare your strategies and alliances, for the Sejm will soon convene under the Speaker's guidance."
